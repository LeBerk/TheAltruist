Welcome to TheAltruist app and its source code! 

Words can't describe the joy I feel. Just a year or two ago I would not be able to understand a single line of code written in this repository. 

And now I AM the creator of the repository. 

If I, the kid who struggled with logic and reasoning his whole life, could do this. You can probably do anything too. 

Here are some valuable lessons I learned working on this project: 
 - Sometimes problems seem to have no solution. Like they were sent by God to completely destory you. In those moments, take a step back maybe go on a 
  a walk or take a nap. Then return to the problem and I'm sure you will find a solution.
